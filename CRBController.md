#### Other Stuff

"C|RB" has two meanings/references:
- "Controller RiBbon"
- The name of my band, cut.rate.box (c.r.b)

The name "Ribbon Sticks" is a funny homage to the Ian Dury and the Blockheads song "Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick" (which I'm not a big fan of, but it's a damn catchy song)

Early prototypes of the ribbon sticks
![A pic of the prototypes of the ribbon sticks - one is paper, the others are laser-cut with penciled-on markings](/images/CRB_sticks_alpha.png)

The back of the ribbon sticks are also laser-engraved and painted (here before all the protective paper has been peeled off)
